            "The Faculty of Arts is the largest in the University of Colombo in terms of student enrolment. The faculty has nine academic Departments and several teaching Units offering courses in the Humanities and Social Sciences. Apart from undergraduate BA courses, several Departments offer courses for Diploma, Masters and PhD degrees. Many students who successfully complete Special BA Degrees eventually register for postgraduate degree programs offered by the Faculty. The English Language Teaching Unit (ELTU) provides undergraduates with a working knowledge of English through its Proficiency Courses in English. There cannot be any dispute that a working knowledge of English offers the student a distinct advantage to society today.\n",
            "The Faculty of Education was established in 1973. In 1975, the Departments of Education of the Peradeniya, Vidyalankara and Vidyodaya Universities were brought to Colombo and merged with the Faculty of Education. The Faculty conducts undergraduate and postgraduate programmes in Education.

It was only once the University of Ceylon was established in 1942 that a course of study for a law degree was designed. In 1947 a Department of Law was established at the University of Peradeniya in the Faculty of Arts and in 1950 the first Law Degree was awarded. This Department was later shifted to the Colombo Campus of the University of Ceylon.A separate Faculty of Law was created in 1968.\n",
            "Historical development of this newly established faculty dates back to 1979 when the Department of Commerce and Management Studies of the University of Colombo was established. Now, the faculty is having six academic departments through which six “Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) Degree Programmes” specialized in Accounting, Business Economics, Finance, Human Resource Management, Management & Organization Studies and Marketing are offered. Further, the faculty has a Postgraduate & Mid-career Development Unit through which specialized MBAs and other extension programmes are being offered.\n",
